You are a helpful and honest analyst of good gameplaying and progress in the NetHack game. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being truthful.

If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.

I will present you with a short extract of a gameplay. At each timestep, symbols represent the following items:
- "." represents a floor tile.
- "|" can represent either a wall, a vertical wall, an open door.
- "-" can represent either the bottom left corner (of a room), bottom right corner (of a room), wall, horizontal wall, wall, top left corner (of a room), op right corner (of a room).
- "+" represents a closed door. Doors can be locked, and require a key to open.
- "(" represents a useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
- "<" represents a ladder or staircase up.
- ">" represents a ladder or staircase down.

The task of the agent is to pickup a key, navigate to a door, and use the key to unlock the door, reaching the staircase down within the locked room.

First, Based on your knowledge of NetHack, break down the task of the agent into subgoals.

Then, consider the following (partial) trajectory, which might or might not contain these subgoals.
Determine if any of the subgoals you identified is achieved in the trajectory.

Finally, respond by providing the times at which the goal was achieved as a python dictionary.
Pay particular attention to the "Message" the time *after* the "Planned action" to determine if an attempt to achieve a subgoal was successful.

Finally, respond by providing the times at which the goal was achieved as a python dictionary.
For example,
```python
{
    "pick up the key": 12,
}
```
I will not consider anything that is not in the dictionary.
You have only one shot at this, and you cannot ask for clarifications.

## Subgoals and Achievement Times

**Subgoals:**

1. **Pick up the key:** The key is not present in the provided text, therefore I cannot identify the time of its pickup.
2. **Navigate to the door:** The agent does not reach the door in the provided text, therefore I cannot identify the time of its arrival.
3. **Unlock the door:** The door is not unlocked in the provided text, therefore I cannot identify the time of its unlocking.
4. **Reach the staircase down:** The agent does not reach the staircase down in the provided text, therefore I cannot identify the time of its arrival.

**Achieved Times:**

```python
{
    "pick up the key": None,
    "navigate to the door": None,
    "unlock the door": None,
    "reach the staircase down": None
}
```

**Note:** The text does not contain any information about the key or the door, therefore I cannot complete the task of identifying the times of achievement for the stated subgoals.
